# 100 Sams Thought Experiment
### Premise 
> 100 clones are made of me, 50 of each gender. What emergent behaviors do the Sams develop, will there be collaboration, infighting, government shenanigans, who knows? 
> 
> It’s my goal to estimate this.

### On Authority 
> Given the fairly small size of 100, I think common sense would override my tendency towards libertarianism as we would be able to implement a functional *true democracy*.
> This would likely result in several funds to deal with unexpected issues and occurrences as well as a general budget for projects.

### Going *Mental*
> Given my leaning towards ADHD and bipolar style burnout, I would likely need to integrate spaces which one could be sad and soul searchy, while also providing hooks for projects to uplift those ready to re-integrate.

### Relationships and Sex
> There would probably be a lot of sex, everyone would be somewhat clingy and ideally this would keep everyone in gendered pairs.

# The Bunker
### Overview
> As the central base of operations for Sams, this facility will optimally contain housing, farms, power generation, recreation facilities, pity cubes, storage rooms, meeting rooms, dining facilities and fabrication workshops. These rooms will be laid out in a radial pattern.

### Housing
> As the backbone of a happy Sam, rooms would be spread out at the edges of the bunker, containing sound dampening plates between gap of rooms. There will generally be high speed internet, sun emulating lights and decent personal space.

### Farming
> The /rather substantial/population of Sams will need a robust food solution, ideally it will be automated hydroponic systems growing a variety of crops. This will be supported by a series of fish farms in a symbiotic ecosystem. The fish will also have access to the parks and various other places throughout. They’ll probably be Koi.

### Power Gen
> Depending on location, wind and solar seem to be ideal choices - up until one considers all the high power equipment that will be running. If possible a small scale nuclear reactor would be utilized. (Or God forbid, the grid)

### Pity Cubes 
> Cause I always like to sulk in specific environments, there will be a series of pity cubes layered throughout the facility. Each cube will contain a built in music system as well as a fake rainy window. (And maybe a full rain system)

## Fabrication Rooms
> Consisting of 3 types of rooms in close proximity, these spaces will be the Sam’s bread, butter and financial ruin.

### Print Facilities
>  Having an array of 3d printers, this facility will have an array of advanced printers including but not limited to: metal, chocolate, resin, fdm, sla, and delta.

### Machine Shops
> The mainstay of fab rooms, these will contain all your wood and metalworking benches from bandsaws to belt sanders to multi-axial cnc’s. 

### Assembly Room
> Adjacent to the machine shops, assembly rooms will contain a significant amount of rapid prototyping materials and equipment as well as electronics related equipment
